WebShop installation

Requirements:
    python 2.5+
    cherrypy
    python-gnupg

Installation:
    svn co https://www.epointsystem.org/svn/vending_machine/webshop
    python setup.py install

Configuration:
    Webshop configuration manager tries to load settings from /etc/webshop.conf,
    if it fails (for example file doesn't exist) the default settings defined in settings.py
    (this file exists in every separate application) loaded instead.

    Each application has its unique set of options.

    Paymentform default settings:
        redirection_target = http://127.0.0.1:8080
        ISSUER = https://www.epointsystem.org/issuer

    See the available options in etc/webshop.conf
    See deploy/app.wsgi.sample for basic initialization procedure
    See deploy/vhost.config.sample for apache wsgi configuration
